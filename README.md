# Memory Technology for Machine Learning
The purpose of this course is to give an in depth understanding for the physics of common **memory device** technologies, and how these memory devices can be integrated to create **neuromorphic hardware** for applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
* **Memory devices of the computer**: SRAM, DRAM, NAND
* **Non-volatile memories**: Memristor, resistive memories (RRAM), phase change memories (PCM), ferroelectric memories (FeRAM) and magnetic memories (STT-MRAM). 
* **Integration of memory devices**: 3D stacking for scalability, crossbar architecture.
* **Neural network architectures**: Feed-forward neural networks, recursive networks. spiking neural networks.
* **Machine learning algorithms**: Backpropagation, gradient descent, Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning, unsupervised learning through STDP.
